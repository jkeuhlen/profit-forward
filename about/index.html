  Profit Forward companies are a rare breed, but they don’t have to be. These companies provide excellent goods and services to their communities. Instead of generating wealth for shareholders, these companies take their profit and invest it in communities that need support. As author, youtuber, and “Crash Course Guy” John Green once said, “long term systemic problems need long term systemic solutions.”

  The companies showcased here pay their commercial success forward. They drive change by building exceptional products, commercializing them, and creating dependable sources of income for charitable efforts around the world.

  Every major feature on this site calls out a company who donates 100% of their profits to charitable causes. That’s what it takes to get our Profit Forward designation. That doesn’t mean there aren’t a number of other businesses who work to create good in the world as well! Lots of companies today offer a “buy one - give one” type of product - which was popularized by TOMS - but that’s not what we’re here to highlight. From time to time, we might feature “Honorable Mentions” - companies that are doing truly amazing work without being fully Profit Forward.
