## About the company 
Patagonia is a well known outdoor apparel and equipment brand. They were an early pioneer in the social entrepreneurship space giving away 1% of sales every year, registering as a B corp, a California Benefit Corporation, ensuring responsible sourcing of materials and labor, etc. Their products were been extremely popular for corporate swag - both because of the quality and brand power of patagonia, but in 2021 they [transitioned away from allowing branding on their gear](https://www.patagonia.com/transitioning-away-from-logos.html) with the hope that fewer items would end up in landfills. But all of that that wasn't enough for them. 

In September of 2022, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard transferred all of the non voting stock of the company to a nonprofit dedicated to defending nature. 

## Where do their profits go? 
All of the profits that Patagonia generates now go to the Holdfast Collective with the intent of helping fight climate change. 

You can read more about the decision to switch to this model [on their website](https://www.patagonia.com/ownership/).

Hopefully, we'll hear more about their efforts in the future and I'll update this section as more information on their impact becomes available.

## Where can I buy it?  
Patagonia has a [number of physical stores](https://www.patagonia.com/store-locator/) but you can also order [online](https://www.patagonia.com/shop).
