## About the company 

Do you like supporting independent artists? How about that fresh, new sock feeling? What about reducing maternal and childhood mortality in impoverished communities? Well boy, do I have the club for you. 


The Awesome Socks Club is a subscription service that opens up a few times every year. They make exactly (or as close to exactly as they can get in any production run) as many socks as they need for each run in order to minimize product waste. So far, theyâ€™ve already donated over $700,000 dollars to strengthen the healthcare system in Sierra Leone. 


## Where do their profits go? 
All profits from the Club go towards building the Maternal Center of Excellence in Sierra Leone. [Partners In Health](https://www.pih.org/maternal-center-excellence) runs the program, and they have a pretty simple statement to get behind. 

> No woman should die giving birth. 

The project has already delivered tangible impacts to the community in Kono District, and your socks could help it be sustainable in the long term.
