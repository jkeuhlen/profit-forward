## About the company 
Newman’s Own is a food and beverage company first known for their salad dressings. Since 1982, they have expanded into a variety of different victuals. Yes, I did just want to write “victuals” here. I could have used “vittle” instead, but now we’re just debating funny words instead of learning about Paul Newman and A.E. Hotchner’s amazing invention of the Profit Forward category. Since founding, Newman’s Own has given over a half billion dollars to charity. 

## Where do their profits go? 
> “The Foundation continues Paul Newman’s commitment to use all the money that it receives from the sale of Newman’s Own products to support children, their families, and their communities.” 
#### [https://newmansown.org/mission/](https://newmansown.org/mission/)

The Foundation splits their money into a number of different charities in these areas. As a 501(c)(3), their most recent financial report is [available to the public](https://newmansown.org/about-us/financials/).
