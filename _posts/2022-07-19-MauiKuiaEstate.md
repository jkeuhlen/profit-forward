## About the company 
So you’ve had chocolate before, everyone has, right? But have you had the unique blend of Maui grown varieties sold by Maui Ku’ia Estate that is both rich, sweet, and uniquely fruity? I have. It’s delicious. If you like chocolate, you should buy some. Seriously, it’s really good. And their pieces are the perfect snacking size. 


Okay enough shilling, back to their story! Maui Ku’ia Estate Chocolate sells two types of chocolate candies: maui grown chocolate and single source ecuadorian chocolates that are infused with locally sourced fruits. They grow as environmentally friendly as they can, and are rebuilding agricultural land that was damaged by irresponsible pineapple farmers. 

It's like you're buying from your neighbor's kid selling candy bars to support their extracurricular activities, except you can buy this year round and the product is 100 times better. 


## Where do their profits go? 
All of the profits go towards supporting a variety of local non profit organizations on Maui. 
> “It is our privilege to be able to give back to the community in which our delicious chocolate is made, by donating 100% of our net profits to Maui charities and non-profit organizations.”

## Where can I buy it?  
You can order all of their products [online](https://mauichocolate.com/collections), and if you're going to visit Maui you can also visit their retail store and do a farm tour/chocolate tasting!
