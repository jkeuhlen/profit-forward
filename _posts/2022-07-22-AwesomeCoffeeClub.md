## About the company 
As sister club to the [Awesome Socks Club](/awesome-socks-club), the Awesome Coffee Club raises money for the same cause: reducing maternal and child mortality in Sierra Leone. But instead of fuzzy sucks to keep your feet warm, itâ€™s delicious, sustainably harvested coffee mailed right to your door. 

The Awesome Coffee Club works extra hard to make sure that the entire supply chain for their coffee is doing awesome things: from the price commitments to farmers all the way to the compostable packaging they ship in. The club is new this year, but they have already donated $100,000 to PIH.

## Where do their profits go? 
All profits from the Club go towards building the Maternal Center of Excellence in Sierra Leone. [Partners In Health](https://www.pih.org/maternal-center-excellence) runs the program, and they have a pretty simple statement to get behind. 

> No woman should die giving birth. 

The project has already delivered tangible impacts to the community in Kono District, and your socks could help it be sustainable in the long term.

## Where can I buy it?  
You can buy this awesome coffee online, but, for reasons of freshness, they only ship to the US.
